# Developers Portfolio page

This is my **first React Project**. I have built this [same webpage](https://github.com/Sduttt/project15) using core HTML CSS and here I have cloned that using React. This project helped me to learn this things:
- Creating a React App from scratch
- Using props
- Creating and using reusable components
- Getting familiar with React environment

You can find the live project [here](https://firstreactapp-subham.netlify.app/)
